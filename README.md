Internship task 5 completed.

Task 5: Create and Connect to a Cloud Database Instance

Objective:
To understand how *Cloud Databases* work by creating a *managed SQL database instance* (like MySQL or PostgreSQL) in the cloud, connecting to it, and performing basic operations.

This task helps you learn *database provisioning, connectivity, and CRUD operations* â€” all in a cloud-managed environment.

Outcome:
I created a MySQL Cloud SQL instance using Google Cloud Skill Boost. I configured public access, connected via Cloud Shell, and created a database and table. I inserted sample data and verified it using SQL queries. This helped me understand DBaaS, connectivity, and basic SQL operations in a cloud-managed environment.
